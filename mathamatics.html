        <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-book-open"></i> Introduction and Importance</h2>
        <p>Mathematics and numeracy also encourage creativity through exploration of patterns, estimation, and creative problem solving, which is in line with EYLF Outcome 4 (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022). This prepares the foundational skills to be ready to enter school and practical life and promotes curiosity and confidence in a culturally responsive way in Australia (Australian Education Research Organisation, 2021). Activities contribute to logical thinking, socialization through collective work, and equality among different learners (Department of Education, New South Wales, 2023).</p>

        <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
        <p>The stages of Piaget facilitate creative assimilation by means of concrete mathematical play (Smith, 2015). Vygotsky emphasizes on socially motivated invention in numeracy learning (Vygotsky, 2004). The framework provided by Torrance focuses on flexibility and originality when it comes to solving mathematical problems (Gajda et al., 2017). The EYLF combines these views to develop creative dispositions in mathematics, encouraging exploration, problem-solving, and cultural relevance to various learners (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022; Australian Education Research Organisation, 2021).</p>

        <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-cubes"></i> Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
        <p>Counters, shapes and beads offer sensory, hands-on experiences with creative mathematical play. Interactive games that can be played on digital tools (such as the Matific app) are aligned with the Australian curriculum, which improves engagement (Australian Education Research Organisation, 2021). Shells and other natural resources promote inclusive, sustainable, and culturally relevant learning processes (Early Childhood Australia, 2021). These diverse materials aid problem solving, pattern recognition and collaboration, encouraging creativity, and addressing the needs of diverse learners and encouraging linkages between abstract concepts and real-world applications as aligned with the early childhood education objectives.</p>

        <p><strong>0â€“2 Years:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Shape sorting: Manipulate textured shapes for patterns (NAEYC, n.d.).</li>
            <li>Rhyme counting: Use fingers for rhythmic numeracy (Zero to Three, n.d.).</li>

        <ul>
            <li>Favorite graphing: Tally items visually (Australian Education Research Organisation, 2021).</li>
            <li>Geometric art: Compose shapes into pictures (No Time For Flash Cards, 2023).</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>6â€“8 Years:</strong></p>
        <ul>
            <li>Fraction baking: Measure ingredients imaginatively (Star Early, n.d.).</li>
            <li>3D modeling: Construct geometric puzzles (Brenneman et al., 2019).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Reflection and Evaluation</h2>
        <p>The results of graphing favourites of 3-5-year-olds and fraction baking of 6-8-year-olds showed that there is a creative learning potential with areas of improvement. The process of graphing promoted visual creativity, which is in line with the emphasis of Torrance on elaboration because children developed detailed categories and were actively involved (Gajda et al., 2017). Collaboration and language were improved in group discussions, but resources were scarce and decreased variety. The use of digital graphing tools may broaden the horizons and maintain the interest (Australian Education Research Organisation, 2021).</p>

        <p>Fraction baking used the idea of tools proposed by Vygotsky in real-life situations and encouraged estimation, problem-solving, and collaboration (Vygotsky, 2004). Safety measures were well handled, which facilitated the confident involvement. Nonetheless, pacing issues were also identified because some children required more time, and it threatened to leave behind the slow learners. Inclusive steps and peer support might enhance inclusivity.</p>

        <p>The activities could be enriched with culturally diverse recipes to make them more relevant, and expand the horizons, and reflective discussions could help to solidify mathematical knowledge. By matching these refinements with EYLF reflective practices, equity, engagement, and creativity of mathematics learning will be enhanced (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022).</p>
