    <h2><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Introduction and Importance</h2>
    <p>Technologies in early childhood education promote creativity since they allow creating in the digital environment, coding, and expressing yourself in multimedia, which promotes EYLF Outcome 5, which provides children with the ability to communicate effectively (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022). In Australia, this is gearing the children towards a digital society and encouraging ethical, balanced use as per national guidelines. Activities develop problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking, and adaptive tools are used to meet the needs of individuals. The combination of technologies will connect the traditional play with modern skills, improving cognitive flexibility, social interactions, and agency and solving the problem of equity in access to all learners (Fielding, 2022; Department of Education, New South Wales, 2023).</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
    <p>Early childhood education technologies encourage creativity because they enable creating in the digital space, coding, and expressing yourself in multimedia, which facilitates EYLF Outcome 5, which offers children the possibility to communicate effectively (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022). In Australia, this is preparing the children for a digital society and promoting the use of it ethically and balanced according to the national guidelines. Activities build problem-solving, teamwork, and creative thinking, and adaptive tools are employed to cater to the individual needs. The blend of technologies will bridge the gap between the traditional play and the contemporary skills, enhancing cognitive flexibility, social interactions, and agency and addressing the issue of equity in access to all learners (Fielding, 2022; Department of Education, New South Wales, 2023).</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
    <p>The materials will be tablets with applications such as ScratchJr to code stories and unplugged materials such as deconstructed toys to explore with their hands. Safe use of technology is informed by Australian eSafety resources (Early Childhood Australia, 2021). Tech-infused art recyclable materials are also multimodal and inclusive of creativity (Fielding, 2022). These tools promote iteration, solving, and collaboration, which is in line with EYLF principles of creative and equitable learning experiences (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022).</p>

            <li>Game design: Invent simple apps on Scratch, innovating stories (Star Early, n.d.).</li>
            <li>Photo editing: Manipulate images for tales, boosting visuals (Fielding, 2022).</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-clipboard-check"></i> Reflection and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The introduction of animation creation to 3-5-year-old children and game design to 6-8-year-old children showed both success and areas to work on. Narrative expression was facilitated by animation activities, which are in line with the schema adaptation of Piaget, as children were able to sequence the events creatively and collaborate with each other (Smith, 2015). Visual tools facilitated inclusivity where the diverse learners could engage fully. But there were some technical problems which interrupted the flow sometimes and the scaffolding was at different levels in different kids. Subsequent sessions are to involve checks of devices and systematic peer assistance to develop independence and enhance creativity involvement (No Time For Flash Cards, 2023).</p>
    <p>The game design activities promoted the Torrance concept of originality, and debugging developed persistence, problem-solving, and digital skills in iterative processes (Gajda et al., 2017). Levels of engagement were high, but there were difficulties with inequality of device-sharing and a lack of time to engage in reflective discussion. To deal with these, collective technology plans and team reflection are suggested, with equal participation and greater learning. The integration of EYLF reflective practices will increase the level of creativity, collaboration, and inclusivity (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022; Star Early, n.d.). On the whole, the two activities showed a high potential to promote creativity in conjunction with deliberate planning and equal access to digital resources.</p>
