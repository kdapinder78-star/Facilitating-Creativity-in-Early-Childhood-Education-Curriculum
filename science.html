    <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-lightbulb"></i> Importance of Science in Facilitating Creativity</h2>
    <p>Science helps to explore and experiment, and by doing so, it helps to develop curiosity and problem-solving. Other activities, such as watching nature or simple experimentation, enable children to form questions and test hypotheses, which improves cognitive flexibility. Science also develops creative thinking whereby it teaches children to think of creative ways of solving problems. It is proposed that practical science activities encourage curiosity and critical thinking, which are key to creative development (The Green Elephant, 2024). Science can therefore be instrumental in developing creativity.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
    <p>Science will assist in exploration and experimentation, and through this, it will assist in developing curiosity and problem-solving. Other things like observation of nature or mere experimentation allow children to generate questions and prove or disprove hypotheses, and this enhances cognitive flexibility. Science also brings about creative thinking in the sense that science makes children think of creative ways of dealing with problems. It is the idea that real-life science tasks promote interest and inquisitiveness, which is a major part of creative growth (The Green Elephant, 2024). Creativity can thus be developed through science.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-cogs"></i> Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
    <p>Magnifying glasses, measuring instruments, natural materials (e.g., leaves, rocks), and basic experiment kits may be used to supplement science learning. These tactile resources stimulate observation, comparison, and discovery of the natural world. Age-appropriate science apps and virtual simulations using digital technologies offer interactive possibilities to visualise concepts that are hard to observe directly. The materials that should be used by teachers should be safe, durable, and developmentally appropriate and should encourage open-ended exploration as opposed to a predetermined result. The integration of physical and digital resources helps develop curiosity, creativity, and problem-solving abilities, which can help children pursue science in real life and in cyberspace.</p>

    <h2 class="icon-title"><i class="fas fa-pen-fancy"></i> Reflection and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>Considering the science curriculum, I emphasised Bubble Play (0â€“2 years) and Baking Soda Volcano (3â€“5 years). Bubble Play was successful in stimulating curiosity and sensory exploration because the infants were watching bubbles floating and bursting. The visual movement promoted tracking skills, and tactile interaction promoted the development of the senses. Nevertheless, some of the infants jumped at the popping sound, which implies that a slower and more gradual introduction might increase the comfort.</p>
    <p>The baking soda volcano activity created a sense of excitement in 3â€“5-year-olds and raised questions as well as motivated hypothesis testing. Children investigated the cause-and-effect phenomena and demonstrated their creative approach to solving the task in modifying the experiment. The sloppy explosions, nonetheless, were difficult to clean up, which is why a more confined configuration was necessary.</p>
    <p>The second time, I would add more variety of sensory materials to infants to expand the scope of exploration and offer guided steps of the experiments to older children to stimulate independent investigation. Both activities were effective in promoting curiosity, creativity, and critical thinking and were also developmentally appropriate and interesting.</p>
