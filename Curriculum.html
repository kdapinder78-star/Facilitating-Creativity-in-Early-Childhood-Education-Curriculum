    <h2><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Introduction and Importance</h2>
    <p>Integrated curriculum models such as STEM, STEAM (arts), STREAM (reading), and STEMIE (innovation) foster holistic creativity through interdisciplinary inquiry, aligning with EYLF goals (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022). In Australia, these approaches enhance problem-solving, innovation, and adaptability while embedding inclusivity and cultural perspectives (Chalmers et al., 2022; Bostan & Tosun, 2022). By blending science, technology, engineering, arts, and mathematics, children develop both analytical and imaginative skills. Such integration prepares learners for real-world challenges, encouraging curiosity, collaboration, and critical reflection (Department of Education, New South Wales, 2023).</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-brain"></i> Creativity Theories and Perspectives</h2>
    <p>The play-based integration advanced by Vygotsky shows how creativity can be enhanced in different fields through collaborative, tool-mediated tasks (Vygotsky, 2004). Cross-schema building introduced by Piaget promotes flexible thinking, which allows the learners to use knowledge in diverse situations (Smith, 2015). The framework developed by Torrance attaches importance to multifaceted originality, which promotes the uniqueness of solutions to interdisciplinary problems (Gajda et al., 2017). The EYLF blends these views to develop culturally responsive, connected, and flexible learning experiences that encourage innovation and problem-solving abilities within a variety of learning environments (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022).</p>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-tools"></i> Resources, Materials, and Digital Technologies</h2>
    <p>Important resources are integrated kits that consist of building blocks, art materials, and books that can be used to explore. Apps such as Osmo provide cross-curricular, interactive learning experiences. The Cool.org Australian STEM programs offer curriculum-linked projects and activities to facilitate inclusivity, sustainability, and creativity (Chalmers et al., 2022; Early Childhood Australia, 2021).</p>

        <li>Garden projects: Plant and document (Bostan & Tosun, 2022).</li>
        <li>Tool inventions: Design artistically (No Time For Flash Cards, 2023).</li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>Eco-innovations: Solve sustainably (Star Early, n.d.).</li>
        <li>Coded art narratives: Integrate digitally (Brenneman et al., 2019).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2><i class="fas fa-search"></i> Reflection and Evaluation</h2>
    <p>The advantages of integrated curriculum were demonstrated in garden projects of 3-5-year-olds and eco-innovations of 6-8-year-olds. The garden activities were effective as they integrated reading and science, which is consistent with the schema development theory postulated by Piaget regarding the observed plant growth and noting them in their journals (Smith, 2015). These activities promoted cooperation, critical thinking and inquisitiveness. Nonetheless, the consistency was influenced by the environmental factors like weather. The indoor planting or virtual garden simulation may be provided in the future to keep the interest alive (Bostan & Tosun, 2022).</p>

    <p>Eco-innovation projects encouraged originality in accordance with the creativity concept developed by Torrance because children were able to come up with sustainable solutions to the real-world concerns, developing confidence and innovation skills (Gajda et al., 2017). There was a lot of enthusiasm, but there were not many opportunities because of the lack of access to various materials. Forming ties with local communities and environmental organizations might help to have genuine resources and context that will make the connection between classroom and real-life practice stronger.</p>

    <p>Both activities may be enhanced by including multimedia documentation, including photos and videos. Considering these refinements in relation to EYLF reflective practices will increase inclusivity, enrich creativity, and advance the interdisciplinary value of STEM, STEAM, STREAM, and STEMIE methodologies (Australian Government Department of Education, 2022; Star Early, n.d.).</p>
